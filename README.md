# Plex Transcoder
This project has taken inspiration from the UnicornTranscoder project.

### Project Goals
- Provide scaleable kubernetes managed transcoding sessions.
- Docker based deployment strategy.
- Support GPU based transcoding.
- Support RAMDISK transcoding on Linux (if possible - Plex seems to support chunking)
